# Heart Disease Prediction using Feedforward Neural Network

This project implements a Feedforward Neural Network (FFN) to predict heart disease using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The model is trained and evaluated using PyTorch, and multiple hyperparameters are tuned to find the optimal configuration.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. To train the model and evaluate its performance:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script for downloading data, preprocessing, training, and evaluating the model.
- `config.py`: Configuration parameters for the model and training.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
